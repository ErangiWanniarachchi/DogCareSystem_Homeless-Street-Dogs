The system includes components namely the mobile app that is used by the community, the mobile app used by the authorized personals at Dogee which has all data of rescued street dogs.  We need to develop mobile app for making a rescue request, being a foster care for a street dog, making donations, being a sponsor for a street dog. And also, we need to develop web portal to use by the Dogee organization. It contains of all data related to processes which are rescuing, hospitalization, adoption. It also contains a separate space to view the ongoing rescue requests.
